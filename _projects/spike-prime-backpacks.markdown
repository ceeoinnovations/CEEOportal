# HOW TO CUSTOMIZE SPIKE™ Prime
## SPIKE Prime Backpacks are extensions for LEGO Education SPIKE Prime.

### Backpack #1: OpenMV Camera
The Open MV camera is the brain for the Camera Backpack that allows you to integrate image processing and machine vision capabilities of the Open MV camera to LEGO SPIKE Prime.

### Backpack #5: Micro:bit
With the Micro:bit Backpack, you can connect a Micro:bit to LEGO SPIKE Prime. You can integrate all the capabilities of a Microbit to the SPIKE Prime. You can also communicate between two Microbits using radio communication.

### Backpack #6: UniversalConnector
The Universal Connector Backpack is basically a wired backpack that converts the SPIKE Prime connectors to generic male header pins. This backpack is super useful if you are planning to make your own backpacks for other micro-controllers.
