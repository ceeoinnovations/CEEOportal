# Overview
## Novel Engineering

- Inspired by kids and grounded in research, Novel Engineering is an innovative approach to integrate engineering and literacy in elementary and middle school.Students use existing classroom literature – stories, novels, and expository texts – as the basis for engineering design challenges that help them identify problems, design realistic solutions, and engage in the Engineering Design Process while reinforcing their literacy skills.

- Pull-up Man is a demonstration of rotational motion converted into linear motion.  It is a simple 2D cam action toy made from cardstock and brass fasteners.  A cam linkage on the back side converts the rotary motion of the crank to the linear motion of the man.  Here are the pieces that make up this kit:


### What does NE look like?

- Read a book and identify problems
     - Through discussion and attentive reading, students collect problems that characters face.
- Scope problems and brainstorm solutions
     - Students consider the needs of the story’s character/client and the context/constraints imposed by the text as they brainstorm possible solutions.
- Design a solution
     - Students work in teams to plan and build a functional prototype that addresses the character’s needs and constraints.
