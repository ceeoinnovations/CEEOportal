# Smart Motors
## A trainable motor for storytelling
Smart Motors aim to lower the barriers of entry into robotics. By lowering the cost and shifting the paradigm from programming a robot to training a robot we aim to make robotics accessible to beginners as well as for teachers who want to introduce robotics in their classrooms.
