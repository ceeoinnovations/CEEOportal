# SymbIOTics
##  An IoT Platform Designed for Elementary School Classrooms
SymbIOTics is an Internet of Things platform designed for elementary school students. The Internet of Things is any network of physical devices that can share information over the internet. IoT technology has the power to revolutionize how we communicate with the devices we use every day and has the potential to help solve some of the worldâ€™s largest problems. As more products are engineered to be internet enabled, it is important that we start teaching young students about smart, connected products. Currently, there are no educational platforms that enable elementary school students to build their own IoT systems. I developed the SymbIOTics system as my undergraduate senior honors thesis as a way to introduce elementary school students to the Internet of Things by allowing them to build their own smart connected products.

### Morse Code Detector

The robot uses machine learning to figure out, for the length you held down the button, whether it is equivalent do a dot or a dash in morse code! But what if it's wrong? It has a built in feature to tell it that it's wrong. This will make it guess more accurately for later presses!
