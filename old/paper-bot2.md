# Overview
The use of robotics as a tool for promoting education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) has grown over the 
last few decades as robotics building kits and programming environments have become available in the market place.  Many districts now have
afterschool robotics programs, at all grade levels, that provide students with an opportunity to engage in robotics engineering, as well as in competitions 
with other schools.
