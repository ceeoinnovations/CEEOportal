# Instructions for Documenting on CEEO Innovations
On CEEO Innovations you can create either "project" pages or "launched" project pages.

 **Launched** pages will automatically redirect to another site if your project has a website and support of it's own.

 **Project pages** will let you write up information about your project on CEEO Innovations.

  **Author profiles** allow you to add pictures and position titles for contributors to your project.

More guidance for each site editing type can be found below:
