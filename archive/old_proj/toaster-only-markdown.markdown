# Meet the "Super Toaster"

This is a project post created only using only Markdown and no text so it has
all of it's text in one block.

## Here are some facts about toasters
- Toasters run on **electricity**
- The first pop up toaster was invented by Charles Strite in 1921
- The original toaster was invented in 1893 by Albert Marsh

Here is some code to run your toaster:

```
int toaster(bool toast){
     if (toast){
          return 6;
     } else {
          return 7;
     }
}
```
